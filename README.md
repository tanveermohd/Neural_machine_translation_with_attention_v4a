# Neural_machine_translation_with_attention_v4a
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25").
Trained the model on a dataset of 10,000 human-readable dates and their equivalent, standardized, machine-readable dates.
